# Competitive Programming
During my first year at the Federal University of Itajub√°, I participated in Programming Competitions where I had the opportunity to compete in different places.

So the purpose of this repository is to share a little bit of the knowledge that my team and I acquired during that time. In this repository there are several resolutions for problems of different sites, as well as our codebook used at the time.

I hope this can help you in something :)
